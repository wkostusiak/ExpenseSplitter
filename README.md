<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Expense Splitter is my final project for college course called P<i>rinciples of computer science - python.</i>
The app allows you to manage spendings and easily split them between your family or friends at the end of every month. 
It tells you what amount of money each user owes the others, assuming equal contribution (eg. for three users expenses are shared between these three people)
The idea behind it is to make managing household budget easier.
